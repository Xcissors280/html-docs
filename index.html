If your favicon isnt working on chrome make sure you have <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico"> or whatever the link is in your HTML 

To port forward or static ip or bridged network on a Hyper-V VM open the network switch manager in the right panel and add a new switch with physical/shared/bridged, then go to the vm settings in the right panel and remove the current switch, add a new device, and select the switch you just created, then it should show up as a normal device on your router.

In Hyper-V VM if you get the ISO/DVD/Disc drive press any key error gen 2 windows uefi, all you have to do is hold space or any key while the VM is starting because there's no wait time, or just use the parsec gpupv scipt

If Windows 11 Home says its not supported on Hyper-V just go to VM settings, security, then check the enable TPM box

Windows bloat is annoying but iot enterprise ltsc non subscription version doesnt have any of it, you can download the iso here https://massgrave.dev/windows_ltsc_links and activate it with massgrave, then get wsreset and appinstaller

If downloads are slow try parallel and or multithreaded download, on chrome its `chrome://flags and allow-parallel-downloading` and on firefox its a little different but about:config and `network.http.max-persistent-connections-per-server`

Most managed google drive accounts dont have a storage limit but the entire organization like a school usually has 100TB total, if you go over this everything will break and they will find who you are
